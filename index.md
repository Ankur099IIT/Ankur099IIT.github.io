CFD analysis of cooling tower fill performance

Cooling tower is the one of the most extensively used heat rejection device used in power plants, HVAC systems and various other process industries. The overall thermal efficiency of power plants depends on the performance of cooling towers to a great extent. In countries like India which are facing great stress with clean water and increasing energy demand, performance of cooling tower is very critical. Currently, I am working on the numerical modelling to calculate the performance of an induced draft cooling towers and hence improving its thermal and hydraulic efficiencies.
